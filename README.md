# Netflix-EDA

The conclusions drawn from the EDA are
##### - The top 5 countries that produced more concent are US, India, UK, Canada and France
##### - Most of the content is released during the months of October to January
##### - The netflix content started increasing from 2005 and increased rapidly from 2010, with highest content in 2018 so far. 
##### - The majority of the content is related to "TV-MA" and "TV-14" ratings.
##### - We have most of the content listed in "International Movies", "dramas" and "Comedy"
##### - In the decade 2010-2020, we see that Movies are released more. But, there are multiple seasons in each TV Show. So, if we consider each season equal to a movie, then we see that from 2018, Netflix is more invested in the TV shows rather than movies. 
##### - Indian movies run longer durations compared to other top countries.
##### - There are few directors who worked on both Movies and TV Shows.
